# Node.js Server Unresponsiveness

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Node.js where a long-running synchronous operation in a request handler blocks the event loop, causing the server to become unresponsive. The `server.js` file contains the problematic code, while `serverSolution.js` shows the corrected version using asynchronous operations.

## Problem

Node.js is single-threaded.  A long-running synchronous operation within the request handler prevents the event loop from processing other requests, leading to unresponsiveness and potentially impacting application performance and stability. 

## Solution

The solution involves refactoring the code to use asynchronous operations or offloading long-running tasks to worker threads or other asynchronous mechanisms.  This allows the event loop to remain responsive and handle other requests concurrently.
